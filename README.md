## Project Overview
This data analysis provides insights into airplane crashes by analyzing various aspect of the data to identify trends,make data-driven decision and gain deeper understanding of the likely causes of airplane crashes.

### Objectives
- Temporal analysis
- Geospatial analysis.
- Operator performanace.
- Aircraft analysis.
- Fatality trends.
- Route analysis.

  
### Data sources
Airplane crash : The primary dataset used for this analysis is 'Airplane Crash Analysis.csv' which provides detailed information on various airplane crashes.

### Tools
- Powerbi ( This was used for used for data cleaning, transformation and visualization ).

### Data cleaning
For the data preparation phase, the following tasks were performed :
1. Data loading and inspection.
2. Handled missing values.
3. Data cleaning and transformation .

### Exploratory Data analysis
EDA involved exploring the airplane crashes to answer the following questions.
- which route has a higher likelihood of incidents.?
- Which operator has the highest number of incident rate ?
- What are the factors contributing to fatalities. ?
- Which year and month had the highest number airplane crash.?

### Results
The result for the analysis are summarized below :
- From the analysis, It was observed that thata the year 1997 recorded the highest number of airplane crash as well as the month of august..
- The severity of the impact during a crash significantly influences the likelihood of fatalities.
- Aeroflot has the highest number of incident rate.
- The location of crash can affect the timeliness of rescue efforts and access to medical assistance impacting survival rates.

### Recommendations
Based on the analysis, we recommend the following :
1. Aircrafts should be designed with modern safety features, such as reinforced cockpit doors, energy-absorbing seats, and improved cabin design, to protect occupants during a crash.
2. Proper use seat belts and other passenger restraints can significantly reduce the risk of fatalities during a crash.
3. Pilots and crew members should be well-trained to effectively handle emergencies and guide passengers to safety
4. Aircrafts should be properly checked for faults before takeoff.

### Limitations 
- I removed null values from fatalities Crew/passengers column because their presence could affect the accuracy of the analysis.
